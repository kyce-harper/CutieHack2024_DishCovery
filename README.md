## DishCovery

DishCovery is a meal generator app built during the **CutieHack 2024** hackathon, a 12-hour event hosted by the University of California, Riverside. This project was created by **Kyce Harper** and **James Mace**, both passionate about cooking and exploring new recipes.

### 🚀 Inspiration

We were inspired to build DishCovery because of our shared love for cooking and our enthusiasm for trying new recipes from diverse culinary origins. Swift was our language of choice since we both use Macs and iPhones and have experience working with it.

### 🌟 What It Does

DishCovery pulls data from a free meal API to provide users with:  
- A picture of a cooked dish.  
- Its area of origin (e.g., the nation of origin).  
- Its category (e.g., chicken, beef, soup, vegan, etc.).  
- A detailed list of ingredients.  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions.
